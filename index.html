            Hello we are Palmtree Entertainmnet we are a group of small indie dev making some open-source projects, discord Bots<br>
            and way more. PalmTree Entertainment was made in about 2017 first started as a Roblox group attempting to make photorealistic horror <br>
            games on Roblox, PalmTree Entertainment was left unyouched for about 3 years until me and my friends decided we wanted to make a vr game <br>
            The game was Called Silent War and was gonna be a campaign driven fps shooter with multiplayer added in the future the game was cancelled<br>
            there was then a new game that was just gonna be like silent war but some developers were no longer working on it no more it is now a 2 man <br>
            project. We are a 4 man team now making all sorts of things such as Servers, Mods, Open-Source Projects, 3D Models Well thats it Have a Great Day
