    <p>Hello i'am Some Programmer you may know me from the Pavlov: Shack Community.
        Or you're just here if you need me for someone but if you need me just go to
        the <a href="./OtherWebPages/Contact.html">Contact</a> <br>
        I'am  13 yr old  and ive been a programmer for 4 years I first started with LUA
         then did a bit of JavaScript' Java and HTML/CSS. One of my first projects with <br>
         any sort of API was a Discord Bot i made the bot when i was starting out it was 
         made in python i followed a bunch of documentation and i have been doing that for <br>
         almost every project ive made. If you need a little project like a website' Discord
          Bot or help in general. I wan't to get a Arduino  so i can experiment with little <br>
          robots.
